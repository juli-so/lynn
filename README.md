===
lynn is a gift I built for one of my dearest friends. 

It happens to be a bookmark app.

### Development
lynn is still in alpha and being heavily developed.
Feature-complete release is planned for v0.3.0 release.

### Try it
If you want to try it anyway:  
1. Clone the repo  
2. Make sure you have coffee-script, and run `cake build`  
3. Navigate to chrome://extensions and load lynn from there  


### Version
0.1.0 | 2014/06/03  
Happy birthday!
